Q1: For two sequence of r.v.'s *(Xn)* and *(Yn)* independent in a same probability space. If *Xn→X,Yn→Y* both in distribution. Do you think *Xn+Yn→X+Y*?
    >Think it carefully. You can modify the statement and make it more tricky.
    
Q2: How to prove any two family of basis of one Hilbert space have the same cardinality?
   >You will find sth amazing in definition of "SUM"

Q3: Do you really think *p(θ∈(a,b))∈{0,1}*?
   >It's an essential difference between a Bayesian and a Frequenist. I have to say: I am totally a Bayesian. 

Q4: For a n.v.s *E. F* is a close subspace, is there a *m* in *F* st. *d(x,F)=d(x,m)*? 
   >There's a sufficient and necessary condition for its holding

Q5: How to construct a r.v. on one probability space that it has the desired distribution?
   >You can search for a THM called Skorokhod's Representation THM, which is one of my most favourite THM in Probability. Read the proof and find sth amazing.

Q6: What's the dual space of *R^∞*?
   >Can you recall the definition of dual space?
