Personal Interests
===

**I am a Cinephile**, enjoying watching films spanning from the 1970s to present day. When I'm not immersed in mathematics, I spend the majority of my free time selecting and watching movies. My all-time favorite director is *Karwei Wong*, who first inspired my love for movies. In fact, I have a dream to be a director. You can see my *Douban* [here](https://www.douban.com/people/210616758/subject_doulists/movie)

The following are my TOP 10:

- *버닝(Burning), directed by 이창동*

- *スワロウテイル(Swallowtail Butterfly), directed by いわい しゅんじ*

- *The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, directed by David Fincher*

- *Fight Club, directed by David Fincher*

- *Days of Being Wild, directed by Karwei Wong*

- *Fallen Angels, directed by Karwei Wong*

- *Interstellar, directed by Christopher Nolan*

- *신세계(New World), directed by 박훈정*

- *Being John Malkovich, directed by Spike Jonze*

- *Drive My Car, directed by Ryusuke Hamaguchi*

**I also enjoy watching series**, although it can be challenging to find high-quality ones. My top two favorite series are(which I consider to be PERFECT):

- *Breaking Bad* 

- *Better Call Saul*

When it comes to Anime, I love *Rick and Morty*, *Attack on Titan*, and *Neon Genesis Evangelion* (these are pretty much all the anime I have watched).

>The character in *Attack on Titan* whom I admire most is *Erwin Smith*. I believe that we are of the same kind of people, both possessing a strong desire to uncover    the truth. I deem that we both agree a saying, *"朝闻道，夕死可矣。"*

 >*"この世の真実が明らかになる瞬間には私が立ち会わなければならない" ― Erwin Smith*

Additionally, I have a great appreciation for the works of *Shinichirō Watanabe*(A DUAL director of *Karwei Wong* in Japaness Anime), *Makoto Shinkai*.

**I love Classical Music.** My most favorite musician is *Johann Sebastian Bach*.

**BTW, I am also a semiprofessional DETECTIVE.**

My MBTI
===

I once took a MBTI test in one class about career planning. Although I think the test may somewhat be a joke, I still put the result here, which may make some sense. 
>People like to treat their daily lives as a theatrical stage, playing the roles that society expects of them in certain situations, as posited by *Erving Goffmana*, one sociologist. Don't let the labels limit you and get lost in such boring things.

Whatever, it seems that I may be a **INTJ-A/INTJ-T**.
>**Mind**: 82% Introverted **Energy**: 77% Intuitiive **Nature**: 68% Thinking **Tactics**: 64% Judging **Identity**: 60% Assertive
