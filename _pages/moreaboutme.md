**I am a MOVIE lover**, enjoring watching the movies varying from 1980s to now. When I'm not doing Math, I will spend most of my time selecting one movie and watch it. My most favourite director is *Karwei Wong*, who is also the first person making me fall love in the movies. I have a dream to be a director.

The following are my TOP 10:

*버닝(Burning), directed by 이창동*

*スワロウテイル(Swallowtail Butterfly), directed by いわい しゅんじ*

*The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, directed by David Fincher*

*Fight Club, directed by David Fincher*

*Days of Being Wild, directed by Karwei Wong*

*Fallen Angels, directed by Karwei Wong*

*Interstellar, directed by Christopher Nolan*

*신세계(New World), directed by 박훈정*

*Being John Malkovich, directed by Spike Jonze*

*Everything Everywhere All at Once, directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert*

**I also enjoying watching Series**(but actually, it' s hard to find high-quality series). My most favourite Series are *Breaking Bad* and *Better call Saul*. As for Anime, I love *Rick and Morty*,*Attack on Titan* and *Neon Genesis Evangelion*(They are almost all the anime I have watched...). I also love the works from Shinichirō Watanabe.
