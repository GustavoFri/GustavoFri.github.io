Hobbies

**I am a MOVIE lover**, enjoying watching films spanning from the 1980s to present day. When I'm not immersed in mathematics, I spend the majority of my free time selecting and watching movies. My all-time favorite director is *Karwei Wong*, who first inspired my love for movies. In fact, I have a dream to be a director.

The following are my TOP 10:

- *버닝(Burning), directed by 이창동*

- *スワロウテイル(Swallowtail Butterfly), directed by いわい しゅんじ*

- *The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, directed by David Fincher*

- *Fight Club, directed by David Fincher*

- *Days of Being Wild, directed by Karwei Wong*

- *Fallen Angels, directed by Karwei Wong*

- *Interstellar, directed by Christopher Nolan*

- *신세계(New World), directed by 박훈정*

- *Being John Malkovich, directed by Spike Jonze*

- *Everything Everywhere All at Once, directed by Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert*

**I also enjoy watching series**, although it can be challenging to find high-quality ones. My top two favorite series are *Breaking Bad* and *Better Call Saul*, which I consider to be PERFECT. When it comes to Anime, I love *Rick and Morty*, *Attack on Titan*, and *Neon Genesis Evangelion* (these are pretty much all the anime I have watched). Additionally, I have a great appreciation for the works of *Shinichirō Watanabe* and *Makoto Shinkai*.
