I am **Runzhe Yang (杨润哲)**, a junior undergraduate student at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), majoring in Statistics and Probability.

I grew up in Huizhou, Guangdong in Southern China.

My primary research interests lie on the area involved both Probability and Analysis, like Stochastic Analysis and SPDE. I am learning Pecorlation Theory and SLE recently, which aroused my interest as well.

Reading Notes
===

I have developed a habit of writing reading notes since I realized that the advanced mathematics is overwhelming, which helps me a lot on building my own knowledge system and reviewing efficiently.

See my reading notes [here](/readingnotes/). Hope it would be helpful for you.
