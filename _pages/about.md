* Hello, Iâ€™m Jinguo!
<br>
* I am a 2+2 student of Australian National University (ANU) and Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU). My program in ANU is Bachelor of Advanced Computing (Honours)
and my major in NPU is Software Engineering. 
<br>
* I started learning computer programming when I was a junior middle school student. I like programming! I am proficient with C++, Python and Pascal. I have used them to take many programming contests. I can also use Matlab, Java and R by doing some course works.
<br>
* My research interest is in Computer Vision (CV), Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
<br>
* To learn more about me, you can have a view of my CV page [here](/cv), or download my resume here: [English version](/files/resume_en.pdf) or [Chinese version](/files/resume_cn.pdf).

* I like writing blogs to summarize the knowledge or record my interesting experiments. I like sharing and discussing things with others. Visit my Chinese blog [here](https://blog.djinguo.com)!
