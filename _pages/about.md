*"Le vent se lève, il faut tenter de vivre." ― Paul Valéry*

Current
===

*I am a Ph.D. program applicant this year, seeking for a Ph.D. position in Probability.*

Profile
===

My name is **Runzhe Yang (杨润哲)**. The Chinese character "润" means moist, nourishing, or abundant, while "哲" was chosen by my parents with the hope that I would always think rationally and calmly.
> My English name is **Reinhard Yang**, which some people interpret as "real heart", while it means "mighty and brave or strong judgment" in German. Or you can simply call me *Reiny*.


I am now a junior undergraduate student at [the School of Mathematics and Statistics](http://maths.whu.edu.cn/Englishversion/), [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), majoring in Statistics and Probability.

I grew up in Huizhou, Guangdong in Southern China.

My primary **research interests** lie in the area involving Probability and Analysis, like Stochastic Analysis and SPDE. I am also interested in Statistical Physics, such as Percolation, SLE and Gaussian Free Fields. 

See my CV [here](../files/cv.pdf)

Education

   >Whatever, I had a good time in Shanghai although getting such a unsatisfying prize. You can see some photos in Shanghai [here](https://www.zhihu.com/question/591749805/answer/2959531767):)

Reading Notes
===
I have formed a habit of taking reading notes since I came to the realization that advanced mathematics can be overwhelming. This practice has been extremely helpful in constructing my personal knowledge system and facilitating efficient review.

See my reading notes [here](/readingnotes/). Hope it would be helpful for you.
