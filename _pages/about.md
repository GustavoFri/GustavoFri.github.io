*I am seeking for some research opportunity about Probability in Summer, 2023.*


Profile
===

I am **Runzhe Yang (杨润哲)**, a junior undergraduate student at [the School of Mathematics and Statistics](http://maths.whu.edu.cn/Englishversion/), [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), majoring in Statistics and Probability.

I grew up in Huizhou, Guangdong in Southern China.

My primary research interests lie on the area involved Probability and Analysis, like Stochastic Analysis, SPDE and Stochastic Process. Recently, Percolation Theory and SLE also arouse my interest.

Reading Notes
===
I have formed a habit of taking reading notes since I came to the realization that advanced mathematics can be overwhelming. This practice has been extremely helpful in constructing my personal knowledge system and facilitating efficient review.

See my reading notes [here](/readingnotes/). Hope it would be helpful for you.
