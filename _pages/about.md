I am fine.

Short Bio
===

My name is **Yang, Runzhe (杨润哲)**. The Chinese character "润" means moist, nourishing, or abundant, while "哲" was chosen by my parents with the hope that I would always think rationally and calmly.

I am now a fourth-year undergraduate student at [the School of Mathematics and Statistics](http://maths.whu.edu.cn/Englishversion/), [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), majoring in Statistics and Probability, on the way of being a probabilist.

I was born in Chaoshan region and grew up in Huizhou, Guangdong in Southern China.

My primary **research interests** lie in the area involving Probability and Analysis.
