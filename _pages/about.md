* Hello, Iâ€™m Jinguo!
<br>
* I am a 2+2 student from Australian National University (ANU) and Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU). My program in ANU is Bachelor of Advanced Computing (Honours)
and my major in NPU is Software Engineering. 
<br>
* I started learning computer programming when I was a junior middle school student. I like programming! I am familiar with C++, Python and Pascal. I have used them to take many programming contests. I can also use Matlab, Java and R by doing some course works.
<br>
* My research interest is in Computer Vision (CV) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). 
<br>
