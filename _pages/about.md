*I am seeking for some research opportunity about Probability in Summer, 2023.*


Short Bio
===

I am **Runzhe Yang (杨润哲)**, a junior undergraduate student at [the School of Mathematics and Statistics](http://maths.whu.edu.cn/Englishversion/), [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), majoring in Statistics and Probability.

I grew up in Huizhou, Guangdong in Southern China.

My primary research interests lie on the area involved Probability Theory and Analysis, like Stochastic Analysis, SPDE and Stochastic Process. I am learning Percolation Theory and SLE recently, which aroused my interest as well.

See my CV [here](../files/cv.pdf)

Reading Notes
===

I have developed a habit of writing reading notes since I realized that the advanced mathematics is overwhelming. It helps me a lot on building my own knowledge system and reviewing efficiently.

See my reading notes [here](/readingnotes/). Hope it would be helpful for you.
